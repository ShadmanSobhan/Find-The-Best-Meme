# Find-The-Best-Meme
This project allows you to search for relevant memes using a natural language query, by computing similarity between text and images using OpenAI’s CLIP model.

The used meme images are available at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TgfuJiKDfqCKO2lkoV9u1Tc6A2Hu-Jz1?usp=sharing

OpenAI’s CLIP model enables multimodal understanding by mapping images and text into a shared embedding space. This allows direct text-to-image retrieval without any task-specific training.

We computed the similarity using "cosine similarity"
